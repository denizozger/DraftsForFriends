Drafts For Friends
================

A Wordpress plugin to share drafts via a URL with anyone for a specific time.

A screenshot is worth a million words:

The code is built on Neville Longbottom's work, but Google says he is a fictional character in Harry Potter, so who knows.

Most of the improvements I have done are listed below:

- Added "Expires after" column
- Applied Wordpress PHP, JS, CSS and HTML coding standards
- Applied Wordpress data validation, internalisation and security best practices
- Proper display for small screen sizes (added media queries)
- Fixed many bugs, most critical being double extensions on page refreshes
- Seperated JS and CSS code to their own files
- Introduced various messages after user actions
